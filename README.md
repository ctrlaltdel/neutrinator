# Neutrinator

This tool is hopefully useful for operators which already had to deep
dive into neutron complexity to figure out why an instance network

# Pre-requisites

1. `$ pip3 install openstacksdk`
2. SSH configuration for password-less login on controllers and compute nodes using the hostname returned by neutron API
